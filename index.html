			 <p>🍿 Broken Vein, 2025 - ★★★½</p>
<p>Very realistic. I mean, a bit too realistic. I have seen people go through similar situations, react the same way (not to that extend but close enough). A great portrait of what being in deep dept in Greece feels like. Felt really anxious watching this film and i attribute that to the movie’s great direction as my psyche was immersed.
I can’t finish the review by not mentioning two things:
One, this is a classic Oikonomidis movie. The curse rate is through the roof so be prepared.
Two, there were some times in the film that were a bit stereotypical and some others that could be left out. I don’t think the director did wrong leaving them in but there was a lot of opportunity to do more to elevate the film (by cutting scenes). I don’t think they were a missed opportunity but rather the movie had me “directing” on top of it which makes the movie fascinating.</p>

			 <p>🍿 The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, 1972 - ★★</p>
<p>A bit fun. Not white amount. Supposedly dark comedy but wasn’t really funny tbh and I love dark comedy’s. Not a bad watch though.</p>

			 <p>🍿 Kokuho, 2025 - ★★★★</p>
<p>This movie is a masterpiece.
As a westerner that is not attuned with kabuki it&rsquo;s performance elements, this movie took me into understanding, to a minimum of course, of what this art theatricality represents. That makes the performances exceptional; to take a viewer that has no clue about an art form to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; a little of what is this all about.
This was a long movie. A life story of Kikuo. It&rsquo;s very tricjy to put a life&rsquo;s story on film as it can get long and boring. In Kokuho though every single element selected was meticulously crafted and selected yet very detailed but not boring.
I really liked this movie.</p>

			 <p>🍿 OBEX, 2025 - ★★★½</p>
<p>Awesome film. Loved the concept, the DIY element, the storyline and the graphics. A great demonstration that all that is needed for a good film is creativity and passion. Watched this at Thessaloniki Film festival after midnight and for didn&rsquo;t loose interest for a moment.
Now I&rsquo;m off to watch Albert&rsquo;s other works.</p>

			 <p>🍿 We Believe You, 2025 - ★★★★ (contains spoilers)</p>
<p>This review may contain spoilers.</p>
<p>An amazing film. Minimalist make which makes it even greater. Really powerful dialogues and actor performances. The whole theater was stunt.</p>
<p>Spoiler notes
I was stocked when the husbands lawyer was making her statement and the camera was focused only at Myriem Akheddiou (Alice - mother). During this shot she performed for us all the emotions that this mother was going through when being exposed to such tough words. The dialogs were so great that when Laurent Capelluto (the father) was making his statement convised me for a second that he was innocent.</p>

			 <p>🍿 Memory of Princess Mumbi, 2025 - ★★★</p>
<p>This was the first film I watched with such extensive use of AI. This moment was monumental for me when I hypothesise that we will be seeing more and more movies coming out that are made using AI.
I felt good when coming out of this film. Yes you can use AI to do the work for you, but as even mentioned in the movie, your signature is the editing and AI can do as much without you editing. Even though the film was, i think, pretty diy most aspects of the film were well presented. I do feel that the transitions of scenes of the film were fast which to my eyes it does resembles our current way we browse the internet and interact with technology</p>
<p>On a last note, I also liked the genuine enthusiasm that the the film had. I might be wrong on this but I do also feel that the film did had an characteristic &ldquo;African&rdquo; expression of joy, which to my ignorant eyes is a regional trait maybe?</p>

			 <p>🍿 KIKA, 2025 - ★★½</p>
<p>Nice film. Everything was correctly made. But just that. I liked the Kika’s turn at the end, or maybe her desperation that lead her to seek some sort of outbreak. Wish I could see it more clearly during the movie. Maybe it was there and I didn’t see it.</p>
