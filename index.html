			 <p>🍿 Silent Friend, 2025 - ★★★★</p>
<p>Really wholesome. Really loved the characters and the connection they all developed with nature and accepted or were being driven by nature&rsquo;s life. Cinematography and direction were extremely well made too

			 <p>🍿 OBEX, 2025 - ★★★½</p>
<p>Awesome film. Loved the concept, the DIY element, the storyline and the graphics. A great demonstration that all that is needed for a good film is creativity and passion. Watched this at Thessaloniki Film festival after midnight and for didn&rsquo;t loose interest for a moment.
Now I&rsquo;m off to watch Albert&rsquo;s other works.</p>

			 <p>🍿 Sunfish (&amp; Other Stories on Green Lake), 2025 - ★★</p>
<p>Nice film. Enjoyed watching it. The connections of characters being around the lake and their storylines were interesting. Nice shooting and directing too. Not a ground breaking film but really cute</p>

			 <p>🍿 We Believe You, 2025 - ★★★★ (contains spoilers)</p>
<p>This review may contain spoilers.</p>
<p>An amazing film. Minimalist make which makes it even greater. Really powerful dialogues and actor performances. The whole theater was stunt.</p>
<p>Spoiler notes
I was stocked when the husbands lawyer was making her statement and the camera was focused only at Myriem Akheddiou (Alice - mother). During this shot she performed for us all the emotions that this mother was going through when being exposed to such tough words. The dialogs were so great that when Laurent Capelluto (the father) was making his statement convised me for a second that he was innocent.</p>

			 <p>🍿 The Anything, 2025 - ★</p>
<p>Really poor. The single star is for the good camera work. This improv should not have been a film.
Could be a good youtube documentary. Great marketing.</p>

			 <p>🍿 Memory of Princess Mumbi, 2025 - ★★★</p>
<p>This was the first film I watched with such extensive use of AI. This moment was monumental for me when I hypothesise that we will be seeing more and more movies coming out that are made using AI.
I felt good when coming out of this film. Yes you can use AI to do the work for you, but as even mentioned in the movie, your signature is the editing and AI can do as much without you editing. Even though the film was, i think, pretty diy most aspects of the film were well presented. I do feel that the transitions of scenes of the film were fast which to my eyes it does resembles our current way we browse the internet and interact with technology</p>
<p>On a last note, I also liked the genuine enthusiasm that the the film had. I might be wrong on this but I do also feel that the film did had an characteristic &ldquo;African&rdquo; expression of joy, which to my ignorant eyes is a regional trait maybe?</p>

			 <p>🍿 KIKA, 2025 - ★★½</p>
<p>Nice film. Everything was correctly made. But just that. I liked the Kika’s turn at the end, or maybe her desperation that lead her to seek some sort of outbreak. Wish I could see it more clearly during the movie. Maybe it was there and I didn’t see it.</p>

<p>Lots of playbook practices to be compelling. Problem is, for me these tricks are passé nowadays.</p>

			 <p>🍿 Don&rsquo;t Let the Sun, 2025 - ★★½</p>
<p>Loved bits from this film. Acting was great, imagery was great, consent was good. I just think that storytelling was a little disconnected; a bit awkward in transition. I liked it he film though</p>
